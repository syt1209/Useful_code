# Changing Delimiters
# You can easily change the delimiter of a file using the tr command. To convert a tab-separated values file named input.tsv to a CSV file named input.csv:

cat input.tsv | tr "\\t" "," > input.csv

# The two arguments given in this command indicate the character to change "\\t" (a tab), and the character to change it to "," (a comma). Similarly, we can convert a CSV file to a TSV file by reversing the arguments:

cat input.csv | tr "," "\\t" > input.tsv
